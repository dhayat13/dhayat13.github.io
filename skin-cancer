Skin cancer is the most common human malignancy, is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions.

This the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset.It consists of 10015 dermatoscopicimages which are released as a training set for academic machine learning purposes and are publiclyavailable through the ISIC archive. This benchmark dataset can be used for machine learning and for comparisons with human experts.

It has 7 different classes of skin cancer which are listed below :
1. Melanocytic nevi
2. Melanoma
3. Benign keratosis-like lesions
4. Basal cell carcinoma
5. Actinic keratoses
6. Vascular lesions
7. Dermatofibroma

In this kernel I will try to detect 7 different classes of skin cancer using Convolution Neural Network with keras tensorflow in backend and then analyse the result to see how the model can be useful in practical scenario.
We will move step by step process to classify 7 classes of cancer.

# First Step
in this step i will install extension Kaggle on google colab because i need to download the dataset from Kaggle datasets.

! pip install -q kaggle
from google.colab import files
files.upload()
! mkdir ~/.kaggle
! cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
! chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
! kaggle datasets download -d kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000
